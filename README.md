# DocumentScanner
Document Scanner using Opencv and C++ 

This project is to demonstrate a opencv and c++ based document Scanner .

This project currently supports only image based scanning i.e. you need to have a document image in a predefined
path and this application will scann the document and align it.

This project can be extended to live video based document scanning.

To build the project you just need to usage cmake in the code directory and it will compile if you have 
setup the path of opencv installtion coorectly in the CMakeLists.txt.

Once the project is compiled it will generate a binary named DocumentScanner

Now you can run this from commandline using ./DocumentScanner on Linux terminal
